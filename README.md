# AAB-APK-Builder-Bundletool
A small console program that makes it easy to build apk files from AAB bundle files using the bundletool

## Note: The program requires 7zip to function

You can compile the program and pass it the path of the aab file and it will create the universal-apk from that aab file using the bundletool
This is a automation tool and will see many updates to add new features down the line.

Below is the snap of a trial build
