# AAB-APK-Builder-Bundletool
A small console program that makes it easy to build apk files from AAB bundle files using the bundletool

## Note: The program requires 7zip to function

### TODO: Add command line arguments, so that we run this program with other tools, just passing the required arguments.

You can compile the program and pass it the path of the aab file and it will create the universal-apk from that aab file using the bundletool
This is a automation tool and will see many updates to add new features down the line.

Below is the snap of a trial build
